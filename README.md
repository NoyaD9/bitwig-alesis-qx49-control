# Bitwig Controller Script for Alesis QX49

The script has been tested on Bitwig 2.1 using an Alesis QX49. It has been created using the Generic MIDI Keyboard control provided by Bitwig.

## How to Use

Please refer to the [official guide](https://www.bitwig.com/en/community/control_scripts/installation_guide "Control Script Installation Guide")

## Features

It behaves like the generic MIDI keyboard provided by Bitwig but it also implements the mappings for the transport keys:
- Play
- Rewind
- Fast Forward
- Stop
- Record
- Loop

## Contribute

Contributions and suggestions on how to improve the script are very welcome.
